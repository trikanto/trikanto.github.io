It's been a long week, for a lot of reasons.
I have three projects in-progress right now.

The first is my scale mitts (or mitt, since so far there's only part of one). These are the reason I first started knitting! I was inspiredby CraftyMutt's scale-knitting blog post. Having done scale maille the "usual" way before, with aluminum chainmaille links, the idea of warm fuzzy scalemaille mitts was so appealing! I loved how it had the look of scalemaille without any of the cold metal-on-skill scratchy bits.

The problem is, I actually am not a fan of knitting scales.

It's _slow_, and I have to plan around them, and ...

...and actually, maybe what I hate is just small-cirucmference circular knitting. I'm too prone to dropping things to use DPNs, and magic loop just feels...tedious.

So I set that aside, and took a new project with me for my Thanksgiving travels. This is my first attempt at colorwork in a while, and my first attempt at writing my own colorwork design. It's a gift, so I won't say too much about it, but...

Well, it's no surprise that colorwork is _fiddly_. Why did I decide it would be worth it to have three colors in a single row ?? Ugh. I haven't even finished the first repeat.

I have two weeks left to finish this one. _Argh!_

I was going to knit some gift hats for my family, too. I've finished 2/3 of those, so I should start my third one, right?

Of course not. This week was Smiley's annual yarn sale in Manhattan, so I picked up some wonderful alpaca yarn and am now knitting a swatch with it - err, I mean, a hat.

I'm in _love_. The yarn is soooo soft and warm and cuddly. And it's just simple knitting, stockinette in the round, on my 16" circulars, in worsted weight. Exactly what I wanted.

The hat will probably be done this weekend, which means that then I'll have to pick up the difficult projects again. _Damn it._
