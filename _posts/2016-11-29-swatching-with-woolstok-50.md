Hats are basically just wearable swatches, right? I wandered into my LYS, feeling a bit under the weather, and walked out with two skeins of Woolstok 50. Then I promptly went home and knit a hat. Now I'm just dithering about whether or not to give the hat away, or keep it.

Woolstok knits up very smoothly. It feels soft, but still wooly. Knitting with it was a pleasure.

There was no dye run-off when I soaked it. I really like the blocked fabric; it feels light and springy, and drapes well.

I'm really craving a sweater made out of this yarn. The colors are gorgeous, and it's a very light and comfortable wool.
