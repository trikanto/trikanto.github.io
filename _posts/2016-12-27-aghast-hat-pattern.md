This Pokémon-inspired hat reminds me of the "Who's that Pokemon??" segments from the TV show. It feature sprites of Ghastly and Gengar.

I knit this with sport-weight yarn in three colors (purple, black, and white) but it would also work well in two colors.

## specifications

## directions

**CO 96 sts** using your preferred cast-on method. I used a long-tail cast-on.

Place beginning of round (BOR) marker and join to knit in the round.

**Work 1x1 ribbing:** (k1, p1), repeat to end of round

Continue to work ribbing for 4" (28 rows).

Knit from chart (see below), working each charted 48-st row twice.

Remember that colorwork charts are read from right to left and top to bottom. Pay attention to [color dominance](http://blog.ysolda.com/ysolda-blog/2014/5/29/technique-thursday-colour-dominance).

**Crown decreases**:

With purple yarn:

**Setup row:** (k 16, pm) rep 6 times.

**Decrease row:** k 13, k2tog, k1, sm, \*k1, ssk, k10, k2tog, k1, sm, rep from \* to end of row

**Knit row:** k\*

Repeat decrease row and knit row until you have 6 sts remaining on your needles. Cut yarn, pull through remaining stitches, and weave in ends.
