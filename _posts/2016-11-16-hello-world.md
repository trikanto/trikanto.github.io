- $4.87 per 100g skein

## comments

I've never worked with Northampton before. The obvious appeal is the price - at just under $5 per generous 247-yard skein, it's pretty affordable.

The yarn is a bit scratchy, but I would still be comfortable wearing it next to my skin. It's already a little fuzzy, so I'm not sure how well it will hold up to use. I didn't have any issues with splitting. At this gauge, the fabric is light and open.

There was no dye run-off when I soaked it. I let the swatch soak for a while, then left it out to dry before measuring.

I'm planning on knitting a Georgetown cardigan with this, I think. I've never knit a seamed garment before, or a cardigan, and it seems like a really educational project.

I wouldn't say it was a _pleasure_ to swatch with this yarn, but it seems like a basic, affordable option, and I didn't mind the feel of it.
